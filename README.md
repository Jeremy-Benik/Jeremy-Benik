### Hi there

My name is Jeremy Benik. I am a research scientist at Bay Area Environmental Research Institute. Previously, I was a graduate research assistant at San Jose State University in the meteorology department in the Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center (WIRC https://www.sjsu.edu/wildfire/index.php) where I worked in the wildfire modeling department under Dr. Adam Kochanski and received my Masters of Science. I received my Bachelors of Science in Atmospheric Science from the University of Nevada, Reno. I also received two minors in Mathematics and Geography. 

Currently, my language of choice is Python, but I also use MATLAB and LaTeX quite a bit and I'm learning Fortran, C++, and javascript. 

If you need to reach me (serious inquiries only), please email me at: Jeremy.Benik@SJSU.edu and allow a few business days for me to respond. 

I have also made some commits to the WRF-SFIRE repository (https://github.com/wrf-sfire/WRF-SFIRE.git) such as implementing and testing the Balbi model and implementing the 40 Scott and Burgen fuel categories and fixing some physical properties within the model. 

Some fun facts about me are I'm a speedcuber (I like to solve Rubik's cubes quickly. Check out my World Cube Association profile https://bit.ly/3kLrpbS), running, music (I play violin and bass guitar), video games (I used to speedrun The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask), I like to learn about ethical hacking in my free time, and I really like traveling (I've been to Canada, Mexico, and Australia).
