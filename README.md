### Hi there

My name is Jeremy Benik. I am a graduate research assistant at San Jose State University in the meteorology department. I am a part of the Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center (WIRC https://www.sjsu.edu/wildfire/index.php) and I work in the wildfire modeling department under Dr. Adam Kochanski where we use WRF-SFIRE to run large-scale simulations on wildfires. I received my Bachelors of Science in Atmospheric Science from the University of Nevada, Reno. I also received two minors in Mathematics and Geography. 

I am currently working on analyzing the fire-inducued circulations during the FireFlux2 experimental burn, installing wrfxpy on NASA HPC's, implementing the Balbi rate of spread model into WRF-SFIRE, and implementing the 40 Scott and Burgen fuel categories into WRF-SFIRE. 

Currently, my language of choice is Python, but I also use MATLAB quite a bit and I'm learning LaTeX, fortran, C++, and javascript. 

If you need to reach me (serious inquiries only), please email me at: Jeremy.Benik@SJSU.edu and allow a few business days for me to respond. 

If you are interested in me for a internship/job positions, please send me an email and I would love to meet up and talk about the position. 

I have also made some commits to the WRF-SFIRE repository (https://github.com/wrf-sfire/WRF-SFIRE.git) such as implementing and testing the Balbi model and implementing the 40 Scott and Burgen fuel categories and fixing some physical properties within the model. 

Some fun facts about me are I'm a speedcuber (I like to solve Rubik's cubes quickly. Check out my World Cube Association profile https://bit.ly/3kLrpbS), running, music (I play violin and bass guitar), video games (I used to speedrun The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask), I like to learn about ethical hacking in my free time, and I really like traveling (I've been to Canada, Mexico, and Australia). 

### Please note, over the next couple days I will be finishing up cleaning up the repo and adding in codes I only had on the server
