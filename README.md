### Hi there

My name is Jeremy Benik. I am a graduate research assistant at San Jose State University in the meteorology department. I am a part of the Wildfire Interdisciplinary Research Center (WIRC https://www.sjsu.edu/wildfire/team/students.php) and I work in the wildfire modeling department under Dr. Adam Kochanski where we use WRF-SFIRE to run large-scale simulations on wildfires. I received my Bachelors of Science in Atmospheric Science from the University of Nevada, Reno. I also received two minors in Mathematics and Geography. 

I am currently working on analyzing the fire-inducued circulations during the FireFlux2 experimental burn, installing wrfxpy on NASA HPC's, implementing the Balbi rate of spread model into WRF-SFIRE, and implementing the 40 Scott and Burgen fuel categories into WRF-SFIRE. 

Currently, my language of choice is Python, but I also use MATLAB quite a bit and I'm learning LaTeX, fortran, C++, and SQL. 

If you need to reach me (serious inquiries only), please email me at: Jeremy.Benik@SJSU.edu and allow a few business days for me to respond. 

If you are interested in me for a internship/job positions, please send me an email and I would love to meet up and talk about the position. 

I have also made some commits to the WRF-SFIRE repository (https://github.com/wrf-sfire/WRF-SFIRE.git) such as implementing and testing the Balbi model and implementing the 40 Scott and Burgen fuel categories. 

Some fun facts about me are I'm a speedcuber (I like to solve Rubik's cubes. My specialty is blindsolving), running, music (I play violin and bass guitar), video games (I used to speedrun The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask), I like to learn about ethical hacking in my free time, and I really like traveling (I've been to Canada, Mexico, and Australia). 

# Please note, if you are here anytime from 1/10/2023-1/25/2023, I am going through and updating all of my repos by adding in README's as well as commenting my code. Please be patient as I work on cleaning up this repo so it's easier to read and navigate
